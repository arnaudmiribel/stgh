# `stgh` Chrome Extension

This Chrome Extension enables you to quickly open the relevant GitHub code of a Streamlit app in a new tab.  
Or vice versa, you can also just open the Streamlit app from the GitHub code!

## TODO

- [ ] On GitHub, modify DOM to also add a button `Open in Streamlit` 
- [ ] Make a better logo...
- [ ] Support when URL ends with parameters e.g. `?page=headliner`
